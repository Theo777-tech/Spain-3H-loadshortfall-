# Project 1 Spain-3H-loadshortfall-
-For this project I worked in a team  to model the shortfall between the energy generated by means of fossil fuels and various renewable sources - for the country of Spain.
-Identified potential errors in the data and cleaned the existing data set;
-Used data engineering techniques such as scaling features  to enrich the data set;
-Determined what features were most important in the modelâ€™s prediction decision using techniques such as variance threshold.
-Built 5 models that was capable of forecasting the three hourly demand shortfall. Namely linear regression, lasso, ridge, decision trees and random forests.
-Evaluated the accuracy of the best machine learning model using metrics such as r squared and the root mean squared error.
-Deployed the model on AWS EC2 instance.
