# [Project 1 Spain-3H-loadshortfall](https://github.com/Theo777-tech/Spain-3H-loadshortfall-)-
1. For this project I worked in a team  to model the shortfall between the energy generated by means of fossil fuels and various renewable sources - for the country of Spain.
2. Identified potential errors in the data and cleaned the existing data set;
3. Used data engineering techniques such as scaling features  to enrich the data set;
4. Determined what features were most important in the modelâ€™s prediction decision using techniques such as variance threshold.
5. Built 5 models that was capable of forecasting the three hourly demand shortfall. Namely linear regression, lasso, ridge, decision trees and random forests.
6. Evaluated the accuracy of the best machine learning model using metrics such as r squared and the root mean squared error.
7. Deployed the model on AWS EC2 instance.
